Small amounts of features:

1. signals
1.1 HUP - recreate squid.conf, and send "reconfigure" signal to squid
1.2 TERM - terminate SAcc
1.3 USR1 - send "logrotate" to Squid, and clean DB (like monthly clean)
1.4 USR2 - set offset=0 and clean all records, for recount
2. make uninstall - saves sql tables to file, and removes all in $prefix$/sacc
