version notes:
 STABLE releases was tested with default values. (on OpenBSD and maybe on linux),
 PRE partially tested (I think much more then CURRENT)
 CURRENT may have some bugs, may not works, but some tests passed.
 CVS - UNTESTED version. Maybe incorrect

0) You must have installed:
	0.1 Apache=>1.3.27 with so enabled [http://httpd.apache.org]
	0.2 PHP =>4.3.3 (5.0.x and 5.1.x is ok) *with* mysql support [http://www.php.net]

	0.4.2 Squid access.log MUST be in NATIVE format [http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/FAQ/FAQ-6.html#ss6.6]
	0.4.3 Squid cache dir (setted in squid.orig.conf) MUST be! (squid -z for details)
	0.5 Check that Squid & apache works, and works under "nobody" account
	0.6 Smb helper needs Samba =>2.2.8a (3.0.x is ok)
1) Prepare:
	1.1 skip.
	1.2 You MUST check that php support enabled in apache.
	check httpd.conf for "AddType application/x-httpd-php .php"
	if not found - maybe you need to add this ^^^
	1.3 check LD settings for mysqlclient.so
		1.3.1 Linux. check /etc/ld.so.conf for mysql library directory
		1.3.2 OpenBSD. execute "ldconfig -r|grep mysql"
		if you have something like that: 
		"search directories: /usr/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/lib/mysql
		50:-lmysqlclient.12.0 => /usr/local/lib/mysql/libmysqlclient.so.12.0"
		it's mean that all ok.
        if mysqlclient.so not found, you must add it. (Read "man 8 ldconfig" for details)
        1.4 You MUST check that MySQL database engine is running.
2) unpack
3) ./configure --help
4) ./configure [options]
5) make&&make install
6) check $prefix/sacc/sql.log for database creation&init errors.
7) check $prefix/sacc/etc for your configurations (squid.orig.conf & pref.php)
 (you may want to compile&&install /addons/chpasswd-ru for NTSC authentication)
10) you may want to install etc/init.d to your system (Linux) for autostart
11) you may want to shedule addons/report or(and) addons/backup
12) Note about start seq.
	12.1 MySQL
	12.2 Apache
	12.3 SAcc
13) Enter to http(s)://hostname/sacc/sa/ with default account "admin/password"
add new System Administrator with your preferred login and delete "admin" (recommended)
	13.5 If error(s) occured, go to http(s)://hostname/sacc/sa/check.php for system check
14) Enter to http(s)://hostname/sacc/admin/ with your account, there you can manage users
15) I recommend that you fix yours firewall rules to deny non-local MySQL use [SECURITY]
16) Auth post configuration
	16.1 NCSA auth: plz create password file
	16.2 SMB place proxyauth to your \\DC\NETLOGON, allow to "all" read them

I'll think it's all......
